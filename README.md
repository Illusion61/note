I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the research project on "Deep Learning Approaches to Predicting Alzheimer's Disease Progression using both Metabolic and Amyloid PET Imaging Data". I am currently an exchange student at UC Berkeley, pursuing my studies in Software Engineering. As a highly motivated and experienced individual with a strong programming background, including proficiency in PyTorch and TensorFlow, and prior completion of medical imaging tasks on Kaggle, I believe that my skills and enthusiasm make me an excellent fit for this project.

In addition to my technical qualifications and passion for medical imaging, I have a deeply personal motivation for contributing to the field of Alzheimer's disease research. Witnessing the struggles faced by elderly individuals affected by Alzheimer's, including the heart-wrenching inability to recognize their own loved ones, has deeply impacted me. The devastating effects of Alzheimer's not only reduce a person's quality of life but also rob them of their memories and identity. This has instilled in me a strong sense of empathy and a determination to make a difference.

It is disheartening to see how Alzheimer's disease significantly diminishes an individual's remaining years of life and causes immense suffering for both patients and their families. I firmly believe that early detection and accurate prediction of Alzheimer's progression can play a crucial role in improving the lives of those affected. By contributing to the development of deep learning approaches for Alzheimer's prediction using metabolic and amyloid PET imaging data, I aspire to raise awareness and enable timely interventions that can potentially delay or mitigate the onset of this debilitating disease.

I am driven by the desire to make a meaningful impact and bring hope to individuals and families affected by Alzheimer's. By leveraging my skills in programming, data analysis, and deep learning, I aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts to advance our understanding of Alzheimer's disease progression and enhance predictive models. I am committed to dedicating my time and expertise to this cause, and I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with experts in the field and work towards a future where Alzheimer's can be detected and managed with greater efficacy.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to contribute my knowledge, skills, and compassion to the research project on Deep Learning Approaches to Predicting Alzheimer's Disease Progression.

I am writing to express my keen interest in participating in the research project on "Re-purposing Large Language Models for Clinical Prediction". As a highly motivated software engineering student currently studying at UC Berkeley as an exchange student, I believe that my strong programming background, proficiency in libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, as well as my experience in natural language processing (NLP) and data analysis make me an ideal candidate for this project.

I am particularly passionate about clinical prediction and its potential to revolutionize healthcare. It is evident that there is a scarcity of experienced physicians, and many individuals refrain from seeking medical attention due to concerns about the cost and accessibility of healthcare. Additionally, diagnostic errors by healthcare professionals are not uncommon. These issues highlight the urgent need to improve clinical prediction methods. By contributing to the field, I aim to develop solutions that can assist healthcare providers in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, improving patient outcomes, and optimizing the efficiency of medical practices.

I firmly believe that the integration of advanced technologies, such as large language models, into clinical prediction can significantly augment the capabilities of healthcare professionals. By leveraging my programming skills and knowledge in NLP, I aspire to make meaningful contributions to the development and implementation of accurate and efficient clinical prediction models. My ultimate goal is to assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions, reducing diagnostic errors, and ultimately improving patient care.

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Back-end Developer position within the research project "Supporting Undergraduate Decision Making with Machine Learning and Human-Centered AI". As a software engineering student currently enrolled in UC Berkeley's exchange program, I believe that my solid programming skills and proficiency in tools such as pandas, MySQL, and Flask make me a suitable candidate for this role.

I am highly proficient in utilizing pandas, MySQL, and Flask, which are essential technologies for back-end development. I have successfully leveraged these tools in previous projects, including the creation of a personalized music recommendation website using Flask as the back-end framework. This experience has allowed me to develop expertise in designing efficient database schemas, implementing optimized indexing strategies, and managing MySQL locks and permissions. My understanding of the underlying data structures and principles of MySQL has enabled me to optimize database performance and ensure data integrity.

Beyond technical skills, I am passionate about leveraging technology to improve decision-making processes and enhance user experiences. The opportunity to work on the project aligns perfectly with my interests. I am excited about the prospect of collaborating with researchers and professionals to develop innovative solutions that empower undergraduate students in their decision-making journey.

#### Improving the Future of Work

- 2D: Building Tools for the Future of Work
  This project does not directly study the future of work; rather we aim to use tools from computer science and machine learning to develop new algorithms, tools, and methodologies that can be used to study the future of work. For example, we are currently using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to estimate how on-demand workers decide among multiple apps they can work for. We have also started building a virtual experimental environment in which human participants can make decisions similar to what they could do in the real-world on-demand economy. We particularly recruit EECS majors and/or those who have experience building the front end/games or implementing various machine learning algorithms.
