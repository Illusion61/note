From my perspective,the subjectivity of teachers is difficult to avoid when giving grades also on students effort.To be precise,teachers will give a higher score to students they like,rather than students who really make effort,since teachers can't see the latter's hard work.As a result,more and more students will try to please the teacher instead of really learn something.That would be terrible.
Meanwhile,Kelly's statement about fairness of grading is a rational one that I agree with since grading on student's effort will interrupt the students' schedule with a higher studying efficency.In other words,these students may already have a studying plan for themselves and they don't need to make much effort on this course to get a high score.Whereas under such grading standard thay have to show their effort to please the teacher,otherwise they would be considered not having a positive studing attitude.Consequently making this idea a suitable one.

From my perspective,the subjectivity of teachers is difficult to avoid when teachers giving grades on students effort.To be precise,teachers will give a relatively better score to students they like,rather than students who make effort.Since teachers can't exactly see the latter's diligent[laborious] work.As a result,more and more students will spend time pleasing their teachers instead of really learning something,worsening the educational system.[dragging the students' academic performance,even corrupting the educational system.]
Meanwhile,I agree with Kelly's rational statement about the fairness of grading.Since since grading on student's effort will interrupt the students who have a higher studying efficency.In other words,those students have scientifically organized and scheduled their academic tasks.[may already have a learning schedule for themselves].Forcing them to focus on the certain subject and to follow the pace of the teachers will only impair their learning efficiency.Consequently making this idea a suitable one.

From my perspective,land desertification is also one crucial factor that affects the environment.To be precise,after centries of overdevelopement of commercial companies and local farmers,many fertile lands suitable for cultivation have turned into barren deserts,and the climate in these regions has shifted from mild and confortable to dry and scorching,causing the reduction of biodiversity and food production. In order to solve this problem by protecting the original ecosystem,governments should prohibit companies from logging trees and farmers from overexploiting land through the establishment of relevant laws and regulations.
Meanwhile,Paul's statement about preventing the overuse of motorized vehicles is an unapplicable one that I disagree with,since building new facilities needs money that governments lacks.In other words,government need to spend money hiring the engineers and the construction workers to build these facilities. Also,subsidises are needed to maintain facilities running.Even worse,the past 4-years pandemic and the economic crisis have worsened the situation.Consequently,making this idea an inappropriate one.

From the perspective of environment,a friendly and comfortable atmosphere can be created through excellent communication of team leaders.This (capability) reveals certain opportunity; for example,workers are more creative in such atmosphere,creating tremendous new ideas for the company,which is of great value.Furthermore,employees are more willing to stay in such teams and companies that they feel comfortable to stay in,and they don't feel tired after a lot of work.
As for Kelly,she stated that leaders without strong technical background cannot have a good understanding about their work.But in my opinion,not all of the work need strong technical background, and you don't need to fully understand it.

From my perspective,a friendly and confortable atmosphere suitable for efficent work can be created through excellent communication of team leaders.To be precise,

大作文:
According to the reading passage,52-hertz whale may be hybrid that have a unique song and different from their parents.However, the professor cast doubt on that theory.Since hybrid,the uniqie kind whose parents are from two different species,travel together with normal whales for they have similar migration pattern,the 52-hz whales,however, travel alone,owning their unique migration pattern.
To begin with,the professor argued the theory that a possibility of being a hybrid exists on the 52-hz whale according to the reading passage.Hybrid,the uniqie kind whose parents are from two different species,travel together with normal whales for they have similar migration pattern,the 52-hz whales,however, travel alone,owning their unique migration pattern.In other words,if the 52-hz whales just happens to fulfill the possibility of being the hybrid,the similarity of migration pattern is expected.

To begin with,the professor argued the theory that a possibility of being a hybrid exists on the 52-hz whale according to the reading passage.A similar migration pattern to the thenormal species of whales is expected,if the 52-hz one remains the traits of their different parents' species.However,difference in migration pattern has been found. And this conflict adds a solid evidence to the professor's argument.
Second,based on the experience of human body,[there is a wrong hypothesis assuming that]a hypothesis is wrongly assumed that this whale carries a faulted hearing system.The professor indicates a fact that the apparatus(器官) of producing sound is the vocal chord but not the ear.Sound would be eventually extremely high pitched if it were born deaf.[虚拟语气]
 
Second,the professor argued the theory that a possibility of posessing a damaged sense of hearing exists on 52-hz whales.The 52-hz whales' sound in high pitch is different from the normal ones ,which only the differences in the physical structure of the throat can explain [instead of the hearing ability].As a result,the relevance between physical structure of throats and hearing is expected.However,there exist no relevance between these two,adding a solid evidence to the professor's argument.

Finally, the professor cast doubt on the possibility that the 52-hertz whales are the only known members of a rare species.The 52-hertz whales should have parents if they are rare species.However,using the advanced technology,scientists haven't found their parents.In other words,the expected voice of other 52-hertz whales have not been detected,which actually adds solid evidence to professor's argument.

The professor cast doubt on [the feasibility of the] strategy of using toxic traps harmful to ants but containing a low concentration of chemicals to eliminate the yellow crazy ant,due to the difficulty of differentiating the yellow crazy ant and the native ants that needed to be protected on that one of the Seychells Islands,and there exists no native ants in Australia in the example.

Used in other places sucessfully,such as an island near Australia,the ant traps concentrated a low level of chemicals aiming to eliminate the ants are not recommended to distribute in a wider range of use as some forests,for example,the one on the Sychelles,may hold a substantial amount of local ant residents worth preserving,which can be killed accidently due to the indiscriminate attract of the toxic trap.

Used in Australia successfully,the toxic traps containing a low concentration of chemicals aiming to eliminate the yellow crazy ants are not recommended  to distribute on one of the Seychelles Islands,for the difficulty of differentiating the yellow crazy ants and the native ants that needed to be protected in the same area;however,such difficulty does not exist in Australia for there exists no native ants.

Introduced from other places recently, the broad-leaved trees serve as an excellent habitat for yellow crazy ants, so [FAN BOYS] these trees are suggested to be removed, as stated in the essay[修饰整句话,要加上逗号]; however, there exist various habitats, that are friendly to the ants, including the open area with sunlight created after the broad-leaved trees are cut, according to the professor.

At the beginning,the professor cast doubt on the theory that the airships will be widely used in the future.Having a vertical lifting force,airships consume less fuel than airplanes and helicopters which use engines for both horizontal movement and vertical lift; however,airships consume expensive lighter-than-air gases,including hydrogen that easily catches fire and causes accidents, and helieum that is difficult to obtain and also does not provide much lifting power as hydrogen does.In conclusion,the airships won't be widely used in the future for they requires low-density gases containing various drawbacks.

At the beginning,the professor .Comparing with the common flight transportations,the airship llights up the engine only when moving forwards and backwards,according to the passage;however the two kinds of low-density gas : hydrogen.....Therefore ,based on the professor's description, cost-saving of fossil fuel is rather not reliable.
lighter-than-air gas: low-density gas

Besides,the professor discussed the challenges on the statement that airships can be used in hard-to-reach places.To be specific,airships are not suitable for tasks in such areas for the potential danger they maycause and the large space airships take.Having the ability to move vertically,airships doesnot require an runway when they take off and land, and airships are able to carry heavier logs compared with helicopters, as stated in the essay; however,airships tend to be difficult to remain steady when they go up and down,especially when they are facing strong winds ,and airships also needs large space to land,otherwise they would crash into the trees.

A more flexible time schedule obtained from the optional attendence for grading entirely on exams and papers is a strength that can be forcasted.Living in a society full of fierce competition,students have to spend time doing internships or extracurricular research, so forcing them to attend the courses will only disrupt their own schedule and impair their ability to compete against [against]others.Furthermore, the new policy still needs the students to have the knowledge to get a better academic performence,so it won't significantly worsen their study [under such rules].
As for Andrew, I disagree with his opinion that the discipline and responsibility are also taught during classes.Since forcing students who have their own schedule to attend such courses to learn knowledge that these students have already mastered will only impair the enthusiasm to learn.


To begin with,the professor casts doubt on the statement that pterosaurs lack the energy to support a powered flight since they were cold[-]blooded.Covered with dense hair on the skin,the pterosaurs could probably preserve the energy[ and maintain its energy in its body].In other words,the pterosaurs had the signal of [being a] warm[-]blooded animal,and possibly had enough energy to support [a] powered flight.
Besides,being as large as a giraffe,the pterosaur could not be kept on the air due to the limitation of weight of animals to stay in the air, as stated in the essay.However,the professor expresses that the bones of pterosaurs were hollow,making them in a low density,which enabled them to fly.
Finally,the professor also casts doubt on the theory that pterosaurs [lacking] power to take off.Lacking big and powerful muscles in back legs,the pterosaurs cannot launch themselves into the air,as stated in the essay.However,the professor expresses the differences between pterosaurs and birds.In other words,pterosaurs had four limbs to push them off the ground[;]instead, the birds only use two legs.As a result,the pterosaurs used four legs to run and jump,and they could still be powerful enough to launch into the air when they took off.


From my perspective,the strong affection to certain brands is the biggest problem when customers buy tech products,since it impairs the customers' rational thinking.With the development of IT industry,many gigantic companies have dominated the market and cultivated a group of their own fans.These groups of people will buy the products of certain brand regardless of the cost-efficency and the quality of the product.
As for Paul,I disagree with his statement that we have to consider the software as  well,since we can customize the software of our own electronic product by our own.For instance,customers can install virtual machine on their computers to use other operating systems,allowing the installation of various different softwares on their computers regardless of the original software.

Subject: Request for Late Arrival Approval as an Exchange Student

Dear extension-intl@berkeley.edu,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to respectfully request your approval for a late arrival at the University of California, Berkeley, as an exchange student from China. Due to visa processing delays and the discrepancy in vacation periods between my home university and UC Berkeley, I regret to inform you that I will be unable to arrive on time for the first week of classes.

I kindly request your understanding and cooperation in granting me permission for a late arrival. I assure you that I will diligently catch up on any missed coursework.

Thank you for considering my request. I sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any additional information or documentation. I look forward to receiving your favorable response.

Yours sincerely,

Sicheng Jiang
